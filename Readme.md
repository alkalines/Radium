# Planning
Me ([@ARLBR10](https://github.com/ARLBR10/)) and Biel ([@Gabriel-Hiss](https://github.com/Gabriel-Hiss)) want an app with features like OpenRouter and its model flexibility but to have an Chatroom, focused on privacy-first with Encrypition on the storage and a good SelfHosted alternative of ChatGPT interface with features more integrate like the memorys feature.
So far our current planned stack is:
- Frontend: NextJS
- Backend: Maybe Convex or Kotlin
- Base for frontend: ClaudeAI Interface
- External use of models: OpenAI Compatible and a Antrophic endpoint

Teorical Features:
- RSA Encrypition on the chat storage.
- ONE or two (max) docker container
- Easy setup and use
- AI Cost tracking
- Fast UI
- Mobile compatibility
